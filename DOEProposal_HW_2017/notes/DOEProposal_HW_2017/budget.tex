\section{Budget}
\label{sec:funding}

The overall budget for the heavy-ion group contribution to the projects includes only the costs of manpower for the study, development and commissioning of the tracker and ECAL FEDs firmware. An hardware upgrade of DAQ and SM can be required but at present cannot be foreseen and properly quantified. Also if not specified directly in this section, extra manpower should be devoted for the support task mentioned in the various sections of this proposal. 

The full chain of development, testing and commissioning will happen at CERN. The test facilities in CERN B906 and B186 will be used in the early phases while the production system will be used for the final commissioning. The interaction with the hardware and the experienced developer is vital for the project. This is why the group of people involved must be stationed at CERN in Geneva.

The members of the team from the heavy-ion groups will consist of an engineer (or postdoctoral associate with firmware development background)  and a MIT research scientist. The engineer will devote 12 months to the project while the MIT research scientist will provisionally devote $50\%$ of its time starting in June untile the end of October 2018. 
 
\textcolor{red}{The fully loaded off-campus base salary of the MIT postdoc is presently ~87K\$. To compensate for the CHF/\$ exchange rate and the higher cost of living in Geneva we will provide Cost of Living Allowance to the postdoc and Per Diem to the graduate students. The exact amount depends on the exchange rate at the time of payment but we estimate it to be about 35K\$ for the postdoc and 15K\$ per student per year. In addition there is some amount allocated for travel to and from Geneva. The costs is summarized in Table~\ref{OpCost} and they all include MIT overhead.}
