\section{Budget}
\label{sec:funding}

The overall budget for the heavy-ion group contribution to the projects includes only the costs of manpower for the study, development and commissioning of the tracker and ECAL FEDs. 
Some hardware can be required to increase the storage manager disk space but it cannot be foreseen at present. 


The full chain of development, testing and commissioning will happen at CERN using the test facilities in CERN B906 and B186.
In addition, the experience developed during testing will be applicable to the installation and commissioning in the
experiment. This is why the group of people involved must be stationed at CERN in Geneva.

The members of the team from the heavy-ion groups will consist of an MIT research scientist, a postdoctoral associate and a graduate student.
The fully loaded off-campus base salary of the MIT postdoc is presently ~87K\$. To compensate for the CHF/\$ exchange
rate and the higher cost of living in Geneva we will provide Cost of Living Allowance to the postdoc and Per Diem to the
graduate students. The exact amount depends on the exchange rate at the time of payment but we estimate it to be about
35K\$ for the postdoc and 15K\$ per student per year. In addition there is some amount allocated for travel
to and from Geneva. The costs is summarized in Table~\ref{OpCost} and they all include MIT overhead.
