\section{Budget}
\label{sec:funding}

In this proposal the overall budget for the MIT heavy-ion group contribution to the projects includes only the costs of manpower for the study, development and commissioning of the tracker and ECAL FEDs firmware. Other hardware upgrades and manpower for the 2018 Pb-Pb run preparations are put in the overal HI group service work budget (CMS Experimental Physics Responsibility the corresponds to the service work that should be provided by each CMS author)  but not taken into account here (some support projects were mentioned in various sections of this proposal).

The full chain of development, testing and commissioning of Tracker and ECAL FW will happen at CERN. The test facilities in CERN B906 and B186 will be used in the early phases while the production system will be used for the final commissioning. The interaction with the hardware and the experienced developer is vital for the project. This is why the group of people involved must be stationed at CERN in Geneva.

The members of the team from the heavy-ion groups will consist of an engineer (or postdoctoral associate with firmware development background)  and a MIT research scientist. The engineer will devote 12 months to the project while the MIT research scientist will devote $50\%$ of its time starting in June until the end of October 2018. 
 

The fully loaded off-campus base salary of the MIT research scientist is presently 87 K\$. To compensate for the CHF/\$ exchange rate and the higher cost of living in Geneva we will provide Cost of Living Allowance to the scientist. The exact amount depends on the exchange rate at the time of payment but we estimate it to be about 31 K\$. In addition there is some amount allocated for travel to and from Geneva. Considering only $50\%$ of its time, the overall base salary plus COLA should be divided by 2. The cost of an engineer is estimated at around 43 K\$ per year. The costs is summarized in Table~\ref{OpCost} and they all include MIT overhead.
