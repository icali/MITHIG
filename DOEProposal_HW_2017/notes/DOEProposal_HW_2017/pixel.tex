\subsection{Silicon Pixel Detector\label{subsec:SiPixel}}
A new silicon pixel detector including 4 layers is being installed and commissioned for the 2017 p-p run. The detector front end electronics and sensors are equivalent to the ones installed in the legacy detector. The whole off-detector electronics was re-designed and the FEDs are based on the latest Xilinx FPGA technology (Virtex-7). The new firmware designs takes already into account high multiplicity events. However, at present the performance of the FED has not been evaluated in HI multiplicity environment. 

An electronics board with the scope to emulate the detector response was designed to perform the commissioning of the off-detector electronics. The test board is able to receive as input a set files with the hit positions and produces at its output link a response equivalent to the one of the actual FE electronics. The pixel group took the responsibility to use the test board and define as soon as possible the pixel operational parameters for Pb-Pb collisions. However, a person in the HI group will act a liaison person and provide the necessary information required by the pixel group to perform the emulation. The liaison person should also supervise the test phases to guarantee perfect adherence with the actual expected condition during collisions. The results of the emulations should be evaluated carefully and possible solutions identified in case the performances are below expectations.
