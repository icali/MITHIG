\section{Management Plan, Personnel, Schedule} \label{sec:management}

The overall organization of the upgrade effort of the tracker and ECAL for the 2018 HI run will be conducted within the
existing management structure of CMS. HI personnel supported by this request will be part of the two corresponding
detector groups and follow the established management procedures within CMS. The project will include the following deliverables:

\begin{itemize}

\item Detailed performance studies of the alternative algorithm for the tracker zero suppression. It
includes the commissioning of the offline software dedicated to the local reconstruction code; 

\item Participate in the re-design of the tracker FED firmware including; 

\item Participation in the phases of validation, test and commissioning of the HI tracker FED firmware in the CMS experiment; 

\item Performance studies on ECAL data reduction, adjusting ECAL operational conditions. This activity implies also a significant re-design of the offline ECAL
local reconstruction 

\end{itemize}


%The pixel FED performance studies are going to be performed by the William Johns and Karl Ecklund. The contact person
%for the HI group is still Ivan Cali. 
%
%The L1 trigger firmware implementation will be performed by the Imperial College group. At present the L1 contacts are:
%Maxime Guilbaud and Ivan Cali. 
%
The schedule of the whole project is driven by the need to complete the project by the beginning of Fall 2018. Then a
few months are left for online operation and final commissioning phases before the 2018 HI run. We have identified the
following milestones in the proposed schedule:

\begin{itemize}
%\item Silicon Pixel FED performance to be evaluated by June 2017;
\item Silicon Tracker zero suppression algorithm performance studies to be finished by June 2017; 

\item Silicon Tracker FW implementation to be completed by April 2018; 

\item Commissioning of the Silicon Tracker FED and corresponding software by September 2018; 

\item ECAL preliminary performance studies to be concluded by June 2017;
 
\item ECAL calibration and corresponding offline software by August 2018;  \

\item Commissioning of the system in CERN/P5, October 2018;
%\item L1 trigger specific algorithms full definition by September 2017; \item L1 trigger algorithm  implementation by
%March 2018;
\end{itemize}

%The full chain of development, testing and commissioning of Tracker and ECAL FW will happen at CERN. The test
%facilities in CERN B906 and B186 will be used in the early phases while the production system will be used for the
%final commissioning. The interaction with the hardware and the experienced developer is vital for the project. This is
%why the group of people involved must be stationed at CERN in Geneva.
