\subsection{L1 trigger\label{subsec:L1Trigger}} For the 2015 Pb-Pb run an upgraded L1 trigger system was designed. The
Stage-1 L1 trigger was operated with specific HI algorithms. However, in the middle of 2016 the full trigger upgrade
(referred as Stage-2 in previous proposals) was installed and commissioned. The upgraded trigger system has a new
layer-1 and the single MP7 board layer-2 was replaced with 9 MP7 boards operating with a time-multiplexed architecture.
Also, the firmware was completely redesigned by the L1 team, including a series of new algorithms specific to p-p
collision operation.

For the 2018 HI run, the specific HI algorithms must be ported to the new system, including a specific background
subtraction, centrality triggers, single-track triggers and Q2 triggers. It was agreed with the L1 team that the Stage-2
engineers would take care of the firmware implementation and commissioning. However, we anticipate the CMS HI group will
conduct the performance studies of the algorithms and a specific description of the implementation. Furthermore, several
tests on the bench or at P5 would be performed by the CMS HI group. Also, the compilation of the L1 and HLT menus would
remain responsibility of the CMS HI group. This work would be done as part of the CMS EPR.
