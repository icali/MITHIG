\subsection{Silicon Pixel Detector\label{subsec:SiPixel}}
A new silicon pixel detector with 4 layers is being installed and commissioned for the 2017 p-p run. The detector front end electronics and sensors are equivalent to the ones installed in the legacy detector. The whole off-detector electronics was re-designed and the FEDs are based on the latest Xilinx FPGA technology (Virtex-7). The new firmware designs already take into account high multiplicity events. However, the performance of the FED has not yet been evaluated in the HI multiplicity environment. 

An electronics board to emulate the detector response was designed to commission the off-detector electronics. The test board is able to receive input files with hit positions and produces at its output link a response equivalent to one of the actual FE electronics. The Pixel group took the responsibility to use the test board and define as soon as possible the pixel operational parameters for Pb-Pb collisions. However, a person in the CMS HI group will act a liaison person and provide the necessary information required by the Pixel group to perform the emulation. The liaison person should also supervise the test phases to guarantee perfect adherence with the expected conditions during collisions. The results of the emulations should be evaluated carefully and possible solutions identified in case the performance is below expectations.
